    "\n",
    "Reuse of code in Jupyter notebooks can be done by either including a raw python source as a magic command\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "%load filename.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "but this just pastes the source into the notebook and creates all kinds of pains regarding code maintenance.\n",
    "\n",
    "A better way is to use a python __module__. A module consists simply (and pythonic) of a directory with a module init file in it (possibly empty) \n",
    "```python\n",
    "libitmal/__init__.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "To this directory you can add modules in form of plain python files, say\n",
    "```python\n",
    "libitmal/utils.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "That's about it! The `libitmal` file tree should now look like\n",
    "```\n",
    "libitmal/\n",
    "├── __init__.py\n",
    "├── __pycache__\n",
    "│   ├── __init__.cpython-36.pyc\n",
    "│   └── utils.cpython-36.pyc\n",
    "├── utils.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "with the cache part only being present once the module has been initialized.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should now be able to use the `libitmal` unit via an import directive, like\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "from libitmal import utils as itmalutils\n",
    "\n",

    "Try out the `libitmal` module from [GITMAL]. Load this module and run the function\n",

    "```python\n",

    "from this module.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Implementation details\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that there is a python module ___include___ search path, that you may have to investigate and modify. For my Linux setup I have an export or declare statement in my .bashrc file, like\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "declare -x PYTHONPATH=~/ASE/ML/itmal:$PYTHONPATH\n",
    "```\n",
    "but your ```itmal```, the [GITMAL] root dir, may be placed elsewhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "For ___Windows___, you have to add `PYTHONPATH` to your user environment variables...see screenshot below (enlarge by modding the image width-tag or find the original png in the Figs directory).\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://itundervisning.ase.au.dk/SWMAL/L01/Figs/Screenshot_windows_enviroment_variables.png\" alt=\"WARNING: could not get image from server.\" style=\"height:250px\" style=\"width:350px\">\n",
    "\n",
    "or if you, like me, hate setting up things in a GUI, and prefer a console, try in a CMD on windows\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "CMD> setx.exe PYTHONPATH \"C:\\Users\\auXXYYZZ\\itmal\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "replacing the username and path with whatever you have. Note that some Windows installations have various security settings enables, so that running `setx.exe` fails. Setting up a MAC should be similar to Linux; just modify your `PYTHONPATH` setting (still to be proven correct?, CEF). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If everything fails you could programmatically add your path to the libitmal directory as\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import sys,os\n",
    "sys.path.append(os.path.expanduser('~/itmal'))\n",

    "### Classes in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Good news: Python got classes. Bad news: they are somewhat obscure compared to C++ classes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Though we will not use object-oriented programming in Python intensively, we still need some basic understanding of Python classes. Let's just dig into a class-demo, here is `MyClass` in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class MyClass:\n",
    "   \n",
    "    def myfun(self):\n",
    "        self.myvar = \"blah\" # NOTE: a per class-instance variable.\n",
    "        print(f\"This is a message inside the class, myvar={self.myvar}.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "myobjectx = MyClass()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: The following exercise assumes some C++ knowledge, in particular the OPRG and OOP courses. If you are an EE-student, or from another Faculty, then ignore the cryptic C++ comments, and jump directly to some Python code instead. It's the Python solution here, that is important!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Qe Extend the class with some public and private functions and member variables\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, private functions and member variables are represented using a naming convention rather than strict access control like some other programming languages. The convention is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Private Functions: To indicate that a function should be treated as private (not part of the public API and intended for internal use within the class), you can prefix its name with an underscore (e.g., _private_function()). While this naming convention suggests that the function is private, it doesn't prevent external access. It's more of a gentle reminder to other developers not to use it outside the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Private Member Variables: Similarly, to indicate that a member variable should be treated as private, you can also prefix its name with an underscore (e.g., _private_variable). Again, this is just a convention, and Python doesn't enforce strict encapsulation, so you can still access the variable from outside the class if you want to.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that Python developers are expected to follow the convention and respect the privacy of functions and variables marked with underscores. However, it's not a technical restriction, and if you really need to access a private function or variable, Python won't prevent you from doing so. The philosophy is often summarized as \"We are all consenting adults here,\" meaning that developers are trusted to use these conventions responsibly.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python classes, self is a reference to the instance of the class itself. It is the first argument to every method defined within a class and is used to access and manipulate the instance's attributes and methods. Think of self as a way to refer to the object that the method is being called on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a breakdown of the role and meaning of self in Python classes:\n",
    "\n",
    "Reference to the Instance: When you create an instance of a class, such as obj = MyClass(), self within the methods of MyClass refers to the specific object obj. This allows you to work with the data and behavior associated with that particular instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Accessing Attributes: Inside class methods, you can use self to access and modify instance-specific attributes. For example, self.attribute_name refers to an attribute of the instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Calling Other Methods: You can call other methods of the same instance using self.method_name(). This allows methods to interact with each other and perform complex operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Initialization: In the constructor method (usually named __init__()), self is used to initialize instance attributes. For example, self.name = name assigns the value of name to the name attribute of the instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you forget to include self as the first parameter in a method defined within a class, such as def myfun():, and then you try to call it using an instance of the class like myobjectx.myfun(), you will encounter a TypeError. This error occurs because when you call a method on an instance, Python automatically passes the instance itself (i.e., self) as the first argument to the method.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you call myobjectx.myfun(), Python implicitly passes myobjectx as the first argument to myfun(). However, since myfun is defined without a self parameter, it expects no arguments but is receiving one (myobjectx), resulting in a TypeError.\n",
    "\n",
    "By including self as the first parameter, you allow the method to access and manipulate the attributes and behavior of the instance to which it belongs.\n",
