    "We aim to create a model predicting the number of streams a song is likely to receive using a dataset that includes artist information, release details, and audio features. Our goal is to explore how these features influence a song’s popularity and build a regression model for stream prediction.\n",
    "We want to see if it is possible to se how popular a song will be. If possible, could this be beneficial for the music industry? If you know what will be a hit you could target your marketing strategies, you could optimize automatic playlist creations and therby enhance user experiences and more.\n",
    "We have chosen a dataset of the most streamed songs in 2023. The list doesn’t only contain songs that are released in the year 2023. The list also contains songs that have been released going back to the 1960’s and thereby provides us with a little broader variety of songs.\n",
    "“This dataset contains a comprehensive list of the most famous songs of 2023 as listed on Spotify. The dataset offers a wealth of features beyond what is typically available in similar datasets. It provides insights into each song’s attributes, popularity, and presence on various music platforms. The dataset includes information such as track name, artist(s) name, release date, Spotify playlists and charts, streaming statistics, Apple Music presence, Deezer presence, Shazam charts, and various audio features.”\n",

    "- streams: Total number of streams on Spotify\n",
    "\n",
    "__Audio Features:__\n",
    "\n",
    "- bpm: Beats per minute, a measure of song tempo\n",
    "- key: Key of the song\n",
    "- mode: Mode of the song (major or minor)\n",
    "- danceability_%: Percentage indicating how suitable the song is for dancing\n",
    "- valence_%: Positivity of the song's musical content\n",

    "- speechiness_%: Amount of spoken words in the song\n",

    "The list above is all the features within the dataset. There are 953 samples. The dataset provides us with an attribute *streams*, which represents the total amount the song has been streamed. This attribute will be used as ground-truth for our model as we will assume that most streams equals to most popular.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We know that there are some factors that we can't take or will not be taken into account and therefor can't be measured.\n",
    "It's difficult to say wether if a song has been used on a score in a movie, in advertisment, a meme ot some othere thing that has made a song more streamed.\n",
    "Furthermore we don't know anything about the listeners demographic which might also could give some insight in wether how much a song would be streamed.\n",
    "There is properbly other things that could influence the number of streams, but we will only be looking at the data within the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on which values are missing we will decide on what to do. A small peak into the data it revealed that only two columns were missing values. The two columns were *in_shazam_chart* missing 50 values and *key* missing 95 values. We haven't decided on what to yet. It kind of depens on what influence it will have on the model. We might have to look and compare the values if there in there forinstance is a coherence between the *key* and how many *streams*. If not ww might just remove the column. The same goes for the *in_shazam_chart*. But if there might be a kind of coherens we might have to fill out the values in the columns. But it's only in about 5% and 10% of the cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "We plan regression analysis using the dataset to predict stream counts. Exploring relationships between features, we aim to develop a model offering insights for targeted music industry strategies, playlist curation, and enhanced user experiences, addressing missing values for model robustness.\n",
